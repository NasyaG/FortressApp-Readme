  <ins>Program Assesment Needs</ins>
  
   It is important for programs like the FA summer program to have asssesments to track the learning and progress of students for pedagogical, and funding reasons. With the immense volume that these students are learning each summer and the qualitative nature of these skills, data can be difficult to quantify. This is where the FortressApp comes in.
